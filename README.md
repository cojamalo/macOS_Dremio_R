# macOS_Dremio_R
The following is a brief walkthrough for how to access tables connected to a Dremio Server using macOS and R, including use with the dbplyr and dplyr packages. The documentation on the Dremio website did not give explicit instructions on how to get this working using the ODBC drivers, so I figured it out myself!
